This  file  contains  about my first project after i completed  my python course.
I don't know  what to write in readme  file.
So i'm writing  some advice to myself.
Keep updating the code frequently to learn new things.

This project  contains main.py , expenses.csv , README files.

main.py performs only add, view  functions.
expenses.csv  stores  data  from add function and gives output data to view function.
